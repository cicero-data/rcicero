## Setup

If you have not done so already, [create an account here.](https://www.cicerodata.com/free-trial/) Creating an account is free, and you will be granted 1000 free credits (1 credit per query). Further use will require the purchase of additional credits.

You need three items to query the API: (1) a key; (2) a user id; and (3) a token. You can find your key in your account profile but must make a `POST` request to obtain your user id and token. 

Stay tuned for more of this `rcicero` vignette...
